# Korg NanoKontrol2

This script is based on the Bitwig Factory Package script with 2 modifications:
* The volume sliders from the Mixer page have been moved to the Device page
* The Device page is now the default/starting page
* The preset change buttons functionality has been disabled (to avoid changing a preset accidentally during a performance)
